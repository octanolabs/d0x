## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, [submitting Github issues](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/), bug reports, feature requests and writing code and/or tests.

## Bug reports

If you think you've found a bug in the software, first make sure you're testing against the *latest* version of the software -- your issue may have been fixed already. If it's not, please check out the issues list on Github and search for similar issues that have already been opened. If there are no issues then please [submit a Github issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

If you can provide a small test case it would greatly help the reproduction of a bug, as well as a a screenshot, and any other information you can provide.


## Feature Requests

If there are features that do not exist yet, we are definitely open to feature requests and detailed proposals. [Open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on our Github which describes the feature or proposal in detail, answer questions like why? how?

## Contributing Code and Documentation Changes

Bug fixes, patches and new features are welcome. Please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what exactly you want to do, someone may already be working on it, or there might be some issues that you need to be aware of before implementing the fix.

There are many ways to fix a problem and it is important to find the best approach before writing a ton of code.
